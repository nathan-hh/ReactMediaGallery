## Description

Showing images and videos in an application is a requirement these days in many apps,
after strageling finding a good library who do it same as the native iOS gallery i've decided to come with a solution myself and help others.
with `ReactMediaGallery` it is very easy to implement.
The library comes with a bunch of built-in features:

- [x] Asynchronous images downloading
- [x] Automatic reprioritizing images downloading - last requests will be on higher so user will wait less
- [x] Rendering and decoding images on the global thread (default iOS do it on the Main)
- [x] Automatic disk / Memory cache
- [x] Navigation Image Transition animation
- [x] Follow back current image index
- [x] Supports images / videos
- [x] Automatic generating videos tumbnails if needed
